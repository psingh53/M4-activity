My parents had five children, and I am the forth one. When I was very young, I knew that I am not like my four brothers. All my brothers are brave and adventurous, but I, on the other hand, was timid and shy. I was scared of being left alone in the house, or going to the woods behind the house I grew up in. When I had to move out of the house, I had to choose an apartment building that was full of neighbors, so that I wouldn't be alone and scared. But even so, I still feared the night. Every night, I could hear some creature moving in the pipes. However, every time when I tried to record the audio with my phone, the noise would stop. I had a bad feeling: not only could the creature see my every move, it could understand what I did and said. 
I was scared of going to sleep because I feared that the creature would try to kill me or do something horrible. One day, I decided to listen to every little sound the creature made. I tried to pinpoint its location but every time the creature made a sound, it would come from a different direction. So, I decided to destroy the wall and expose the pipelines. With the pipelines exposed, I decided to disconnect the pipes and created a trap at the end of the pipe. I waited for the whole day to catch the creature but there was no sound of the creature at all. I was so tired that I just fell asleep waiting to catch the creature. Suddenly, I heard a loud sound the creature getting caught and you would not believe what was the creature?

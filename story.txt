My parents had five children, and I am the forth one. When I was very young, I knew that I am not like my four brothers. All my brothers are brave and adventurous, but I, on the other hand, was timid and shy. I was scared of being left alone in the house, or going to the woods behind the house I grew up in. When I had to move out of the house, I had to choose an apartment building that was full of neighbors, so that I wouldn't be alone and scared. But even so, I still feared the night. Every night, I could hear some creature moving in the pipes. However, every time when I tried to record the audio with my phone, the noise would stop. I had a bad feeling: not only could the creature see my every move, it could understand what I did and said.
A couple weeks have gone by and I haven't heard the sounds. I figured that the creature must just have died in the pipes, or left for a warmer home, but boy was I wrong. It was Christmas weekend, and I was unable to visit my family due to work. The usual hum of my apartment complex had died down, as most tenets had left to visit their relatives. Dreary eyed, I sat in front of my television, hoping to catch some late night Christmas specials - though every channel I turned to relayed static. I figured it was the snow's fault. I decided to go to bed early, and try to get some rest, but as soon as I started to drift to sleep, I heard it; a sharp scrape on the bedroom door.
I decided to get up and open the door instead of being scared of the sound. When I opened the door, I saw that creature sitting and looking at me with a look of anger. The creature was a cat. The sound in the beginning wasn't inside the wall in the pipelines. It was actually the neighbor's cat playing near the pipelines. All of this time, I was just paranoid that there was a creature watching me. At the end, I just laughed at myself for being scared for no reason.
